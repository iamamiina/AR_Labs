8-connected grid search with octile heuristic. Operates on a 2D bool array

    Octile distance between two grid cells — admissible heuristic for an
    8-connected grid where cardinal moves cost 1 and diagonal moves cost sqrt(2).

    For two cells with row/col deltas dr and dc:
        h = (dr + dc) + (sqrt(2) - 2) * min(dr, dc)

    Intuition: take min(dr, dc) diagonal steps, then |dr - dc| straight steps.

    Args:
        a, b: (row, col) cells.

    Returns:
        Estimated cost (lower bound on true path cost) from a to b.

    Hints:
        - 1 line of code.
        - Use abs() and min().
